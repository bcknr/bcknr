<h3> Mark Buckner </h3>
<h4> About Me </h4>
<p>
I am a PhD Candidate in the Danforth Lab at Cornell University, where I research global change ecology and native bee conservation using distribution modeling. My research interests stem from a desire to leverage existing historical records and community science programs to develop resources for conservation decision-making and prioritization in data-poor study systems. 
<br><br>
Born and raised in Colorado's Front Range and educated at the University of Montana, I still question how I ended up out east. But even here, where I'm convinced you can walk little more than a mile before running into a road, I enjoy spending time in nature. When not modeling and mapping species distributions, I can often be found hiking, fly fishing, or <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Looking for porcupine"> "porcupining."</span>

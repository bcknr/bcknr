By evaluating how species respond to the changing environment, I aim to provide resources for land management decision-making and biodiversity conservation.\nHistorically, insect populations lacked detailed, structured, and long-term surveys. The need for more data presents a challenge in prioritizing conservation action. By leveraging community science data and collection records with Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) methods, we can better evaluate how species may respond to a suite of interacting drivers of global change.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n Forecasting the Impacts of Global Change on a Bee Biodiversity Hotspot \n\nThe American Southwest is a hotspot for rapid climate change, land conversion, and bee biodiversity. Home to nearly 1,000 species, we are using Joint SDMs to evaluate how global change might impact species richness in the region and how to mitigate the threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n Climate-driven range shifts in a rare specialist bee \nMost specialists bees collect pollen from species within the same family of plants. Macropis nuda only collects pollens and oils from a couple of species. Our recent Global Ecology and Conservation publication explored how this species and its primary host plant might respond to the changing climate."

My research interests stem from a desire to leverage existing historical records and community science programs to develop resources for conservation decision-making and prioritization in data-poor study systems. \n\nBorn and raised in Colorado's Front Range and educated at the University of Montana, I still question how I ended up out east. But even here, where I'm convinced you can walk little more than a mile before running into a road, I enjoy spending time in nature. When not modeling and mapping species distributions, I can often be found hiking, fly fishing, or  \"porcupining.\""

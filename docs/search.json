Each of the nine modules introduces a key topic in bee biology ranging from bee phylogeny and diversity to the role of mason bees as pollinators to bee decline and conservation.\nThe program was created in partnership with high school science educators, education and outreach experts, and industry partners from the New York State Master Teachers Program, Museum of the Earth, and Crown Bees. Each module includes an “educate the educator” background section, a list of vocabulary and resources, and a classroom activity.\nMason Bee Edu is available free of charge at Crown Bees\n\nBuckner M, Danforth B.

    "text": "Mark Buckner, PhD \n About Me \n\nI recently graduated with a PhD from Cornell University, where I research global change ecology and native bee conservation using distribution modeling in the Danforth Lab. My research focus stems from an interest in leveraging existing historical records and community science programs to develop resources for conservation decision-making and prioritization in data-poor study systems. \n\nBorn and raised in Colorado's Front Range and educated at the University of Montana, I still question how I ended up out east for my PhD. I enjoy spending time in nature. When not modeling and mapping species distributions, I can often be found hiking, fly fishing, or \"porcupining.\"\n\n\n\n Education \nPhD | Cornell University\nInsect Ecology, Applied Ecology, Quantitative Ecology, Applied Statistics\nDissertation: “Cartograph-Bee: Mapping Data-Limited Native Bee Diversity and Distributions to Inform Conservation Action”\n\nBS | University of Montana\nEcology and Organismal Biology"

By evaluating how species respond to the changing environment, I aim to provide resources for land management decision-making and biodiversity conservation.\nHistorically, insect populations lacked detailed, structured, and long-term surveys. The need for more data presents a challenge in prioritizing conservation action. By leveraging community science data and collection records with Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), we can better evaluate how species may respond to a suite of interacting drivers of global change.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n Fine-scale Models of Bee Diversity and Habitat in New York State \n\nThe local context required for implementing effective conservation actions is often missing from global analyses of bee diversity. Using records from the Empire State Native Pollinator Survey and GBIF, we are modeling how bee species are distributed across the state of New York and what habitats may be of high conservation value. Read the preprint on bioRxiv.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n Forecasting the Impacts of Global Change on a Bee Biodiversity Hotspot \n\nThe American Southwest is a hotspot for rapid climate change, land conversion, and bee biodiversity. Home to nearly 1/4 of US bee species, we are using Joint SDMs to evaluate how global change might impact species richness in the region and how to mitigate the threat. Read the preprint on bioRxiv.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n       \n  \n\n Climate-driven range shifts in a rare specialist bee \nMost specialists bees collect pollen from species within the same family of plants. Macropis nuda only collects pollens and oils from a couple of species. Our recent Global Ecology and Conservation publication explored how this species and its primary host plant might respond to the changing climate."
